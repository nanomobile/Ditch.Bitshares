     * process a recurring payment may use a @ref withdraw_permission_claim_operation to reference an object of this type
     * and withdraw up to @ref withdrawal_limit from @ref withdraw_from_account. Only @ref authorized_account may do
     * this. Any number of withdrawals may be made so long as the total amount withdrawn per period does not exceed the
     * limit for any given period.
